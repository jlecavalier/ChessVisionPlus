# ChessVisionPlus
App for Android that improves your ability to notice different moves on the chessboard

# NOTE:
This app is under heavy construction. It's coming along nicely though! I have a lot of motivation to finish this project because I actually want to use it in my day to day life for improving my chess.

# What it does so far
Thus far, the app generates a chessboard and generates the correct ID for each square on the board using the standard algebraic chess notation. You can tap on a square, and the app will tell you which square you tapped most recently on the screen

# Future plans
The reason this app is called ChessVisionPlus is because I wanted to create an app that improves the way you look at the chess board. I wanted to be able to know the correct name of each square on the board without even having to think about it at all, and also be able to see all the squares my pieces can move to without having to think about it at all.

First of all, I'd like to implement a simple exercise, where the app gives you the algebraic name of a square and your goal is to touch that square. This exercise will allow users to learn the names of all the squares on the chess board very quickly. The goal is to practice enough that the name of each square eventually becomes second nature.

Second of all, I'd like to implement another exercise where a knight is placed on a random square on the board and the user must tap all the squares that the knight can legally move to. With enough practice, the user will eventually be able to see the squares that knights can move to without even thinking about it at all.

I think these two exercises (and possibly some other ones in the future) will help me improve my chess gameplay, and I hope it will eventually also help other chess players with access to android devices.
